                    <p class="title">Hello, world!</p>
                    <p>I aspire to be a<span class="emphysis">versatile tech professional</span>, ranging from full-stack development and security research (bug bounty) to product building and technical project management.</p>
                    <p>I'm a <span class="emphysis">responsible</span>, <span class="emphysis">inventive</span> and <span class="emphysis">enthusiastic</span> person. So, please feel free to email me if you have any question! :D</p>

                    <p class="title">Skills</p>
                    <p>I have experience in web development, with a strong focus on full-stack technologies and front-end problem solving.<span class="emphysis">HTML</span>, <span class="emphysis">CSS</span>, <span class="emphysis">JavaScript</span>,and
                        so on. Not a professional yet, but I'm on my way...
                        <p>
                            <p>I also have hands-on knowledge of back-end technologies and databases, including<span class="emphysis">PHP</span>, <span class="emphysis">MySQL</span> , and I enjoy understanding how systems work end-to-end rather than treating
                                the front end in isolation. In addition, I have a growing interest and practical exposure to security and bug bounty research, where I focus on real-world applications instead of pure theory, strengthening my analytical
                                and defensive thinking.</p>
                            <p>I’ve worked on multiple projects in <span class="emphysis">C</span> and <span class="emphysis">Python</span>, which reinforced my problem-solving skills and confirmed my passion for building scalable and well-structured systems.</p>
                            <p>These skills listed here are only a glimpse of who I am. Their real value appears when combined with leadership, curiosity, and a builder’s mindset.</p>

                        <p>Being one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century, <span class="term">Alan Turing</span> inspired and shaped the way we understand computation, intelligence, and problem-solving. His work laid the foundation for modern
                            computing, showing how abstract ideas can translate into real-world systems.</p>
                        <p>I have learned to tackle problems step by step, focus on achievable goals, and know when it is time to pivot or iterate. This mindset allows me to innovate responsibly, build efficiently, and remain creative in both code and project
                            management.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Turing’s approach reminds me that everything is about perspective and process. Just as he framed problems in a logical, systematic way, I approach my projects as a tech-driven builder — whether designing systems, developing software, or leading technical
                            projects. Challenges are not obstacles but guides, helping define solutions and improvements.
                        </p>

                        <p>Of course, understanding the full depth of problem-solving and creation is a lifelong journey. As Turing showed, the best solutions emerge when curiosity, experimentation, and disciplined thinking meet.</p>

                            <p>Deep Cam is a project I developed to experiment with face swapping using AI. The idea was to explore how modern machine learning techniques can manipulate and transform images in real time, while ensuring the results are realistic
                                and user-friendly. This project allowed me to dive deep into computer vision, neural networks, and image processing, strengthening both my programming skills and my understanding of AI applications.</p>

                            <p> As with all my projects, the technical skills alone are not enough. The real value comes from identifying potential use cases and presenting them through intuitive interfaces that users can interact with seamlessly.</p>

                        <p>I’ve been exploring Japanese language and culture out of curiosity and passion. I wouldn’t say I master it yet, but with patience and persistence, I enjoy discovering new words, expressions, and ways of thinking. Just like coding
                            or sketching, learning a language is a tool to expand understanding and connect with the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>I enjoy experimenting and stepping out of my comfort zone, whether it’s a new project, technique, or challenge. Through trial and exploration, I’ve learned to approach tasks calmly and adaptively — letting things flow naturally
                            without forcing outcomes, a principle inspired by Tao.</p>
                        <p>Started as a hobby, I’ve been teaching myself anything related to pc since 2012. I wouldn’t call myself naturally gifted, but with the guidance of Allah, I learned quickly and gained confidence. Observing others, I realized that
                            all about contrast, balance, and composition. Once you grasp that essence, light, form, and perspective become easier to manage.</p>
